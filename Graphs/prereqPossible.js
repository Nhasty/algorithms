// Write a function, prereqsPossible, that takes in a number of courses (n) and prerequisites as arguments. Courses have ids ranging from 0 through n - 1. A single prerequisite of [A, B] means that course A must be taken before course B. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to complete all courses.

const prereqsPossible = (numCourses, prereqs) => {
  // todo
  const visited = new Set();
  const graph = writeUnidirectionalGraph(numCourses, pre)
};
